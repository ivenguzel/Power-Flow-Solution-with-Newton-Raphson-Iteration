# Power-Flow-Solution-with-Newton-Raphson-Iteration
Second term project of METU-EE472 Power System Analysis II, Spring 2019 Class. 
Aim: Implement a function in MATLAB environment that can solve power flow problem
using data from an input file in common data format (cdf). Your code should be capable
of solving power flow problem for different systems (e.g. IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE
118-bus system, etc.)
